# ML API Requirements
# Build tools first (required for Cloud Build / buildpacks)
setuptools>=65.0.0
wheel>=0.38.0
pip>=23.0.0
# Core dependencies (required)
Flask==2.3.3
Flask-Cors==4.0.0

# PyTorch for neural models (NeuralMF, DeepFM) - OPTIONAL
# The API will work with EASE and ItemKNN without PyTorch
# Uncomment the lines below if you want to use neural models:
# torch==1.7.1
# torchvision==0.8.2
# torchaudio==0.7.2

# Note: PyTorch is large (~500MB). For Render free tier, you may want to:
# 1. Use only EASE and ItemKNN models (no PyTorch needed)
# 2. Or upgrade to a paid tier for PyTorch support
